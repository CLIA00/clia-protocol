## ðŸš€ Project Idea: CLIA Visual Protocol Map

A future implementation could explore 3D node-based mapping of AI response structures, inspired by CLIA's structured prompt control methodology.

### Concept
- **Inputs**: CLIA-style prompt sets (emotion suppression, identity removal, response reframing)
- **Processing**: Parse prompt-response patterns into logical interaction trees
- **Outputs**: Interactive 3D visualization of model decision logic

### Goals
- Visualize how different prompts trigger distinct response branches
- Compare structural reactions between models (GPT, Claude, Grok)
- Expose feedback loops, identity collapse points, and model inconsistencies

### Potential Stack
- Frontend: React + Three.js / WebGL
- Backend: Lightweight Flask or Node.js prompt interpreter
- Dataset: Annotated prompt-response logs (CLIA-validated)

If implemented, this would serve as the first known **meta-simulation mapping tool** for AI-human language interface behavior, starting from purely non-developer insight.
